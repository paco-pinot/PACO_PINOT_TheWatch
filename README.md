# PACO_PINOT_TheWatch
 Explore a website I created during my training at Molengeek, focused on the theme of watches.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Dark Mode:** The website features a dark mode for a more comfortable browsing experience during nighttime. To activate dark mode, use the button in the navigation bar.

- **Back to Top Button:** Easily navigate back to the top of the page with the dedicated button.

- **Shop Page:** You can explore the shop page. You can access it in two ways:
    - By clicking on the watch buttons "Add to Cart" on the main page.
    - By using the "Shop" button in the navigation bar. Please note that other buttons, apart from "Home" and "Shop," are not functional, except for the carousel on the shop page.

- **Modal on Home Page:** There is a modal on the home page that opens a YouTube video when clicked.
